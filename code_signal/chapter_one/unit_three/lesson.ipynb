    "# Topic Introduction and Actualization\n",
    "Welcome to the next leg of our journey with the Titanic Survival Data - wielding the power of Descriptive Statistics with Numpy and Pandas! In this lesson, we will cover how to use both these libraries to perform descriptive statistical analysis on our dataset. By the end of this lesson, you will have gained the ability to calculate measures of central tendencies such as mean, median, and mode and understand how to interpret measures of variability, quartiles, and percentiles.\n",

    "Why should we care about learning descriptive statistics? Well, simply put, descriptive statistics provide powerful, informative summaries of our data, allowing us to understand the nature and distribution of our data even before embarking on any form of machine learning or data prediction. Armed with this understanding, we are better equipped to carry out accurate analyses and produce meaningful insights from our data. Ready to investigate the Titanic dataset more thoroughly? Then, let's dive in!"

    "# Measures of Variability: Standard Deviation\n",
    "Apart from measures of central tendency, there is another important style of measurement in statistics - measures of dispersion (variability). One of the common ways to gauge the variability in a dataset is via the standard deviation, which measures how much the values in a dataset vary around the mean. A super low standard deviation indicates a dataset with values clustered around the mean, while a higher standard deviation represents a wider spread around the mean. For our Titanic dataset, we can calculate the standard deviation of age as follows:"
