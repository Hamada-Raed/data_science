    "# Welcome to the Next Journey - Data Filtering and Sorting with Pandas\n",
    "Hello, fellow explorer! Today, we are going to delve into another exciting segment of your data science expedition: Data Filtering and Sorting with Pandas. You'll learn how to narrow down your data to match certain criteria and arrange it in a particular order. This is a fundamental skill when handling data, enabling us to extract valuable information quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, data analysis isn't about dealing with entire datasets but concerning yourself with specific slices of it. For instance, in our Titanic dataset, you might be interested in passengers who survived or those within a certain age group. How about arranging the data based on Fare or Age? That's where data filtering and sorting come into play!\n",
