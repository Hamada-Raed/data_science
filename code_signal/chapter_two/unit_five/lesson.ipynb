    "# Setting the Stage\n",
    "Can you recall from our last lesson how we used Seaborn to make our plots more aesthetically pleasing? We'll continue our journey with Seaborn in this lesson, but this time, we'll explore a different type of visualization - histograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms are powerful graphical representations that allow us to inspect the underlying frequency distribution (shape) of a continuous or discrete data set. This is particularly useful when we want to visualize the distribution of a variable over a range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is understanding the data distribution important, you might ask? In the field of data analytics and statistics, most statistical tests and models assume certain data distribution patterns. Histograms, therefore, are ways for us to validate these assumptions. In other words, knowing our data well sets the stage for more complex analyses later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will take you further into Seaborn's capabilities. We'll cover how to create and customize histograms, offering a sharper lens to inspect our Titanic dataset.\n",

    "# Diving into Histograms\n",
    "Let's illustrate a histogram using the passenger ages (age) from titanic_df. As we saw in our previous lessons, there were a variety of ages amongst the passengers that should make for an interesting distribution.\n",

    "The KDE is useful when we want to derive a smooth, continuous function from our discrete observations. Often, this can make the output much more interpretable, aiding in the presentation of our data. However, remember that KDEs are just estimates. The true distribution of your data may be different, especially if you have a small number of observations.\n",

    "- hue: This is a very important parameter when you have a categorical column that you want to represent on the histogram. The hue parameter instructs seaborn to color the histogram bars for the age distribution differently depending on the passenger's gender values (i.e., male or female).\n",
    "multiple: This parameter is used with hue to change how the different categories are displayed on the histogram. The default is \"layer\", but you could set it to \"stack\", \"fill\" or \"dodge\".\n",
    "- \"layer\": Draw one histogram per variable. Each histogram will represent a separate layer; layers will be superimposed on each other.\n",
    "- \"stack\": Draw one histogram, stacking the values of each variable on top of the other.\n",
    "- \"fill\": Draw one histogram, with the area of each filled up to the total height, the cumulating contribution of each variable (like a percentage plot, where the whole plot is 100%).\n",
    "- \"dodge\": Draw one histogram, but \"dodge\" them, i.e., move them slightly to the side so each contributes to the overall figure separately and all can be seen.\n",
    "- palette: This parameter allows you to change the colors used for the different categories.\n",
    "binwidth: This parameter allows you to set the width of the bins rather than the number of bins. This can be useful for a more direct control of the granularity of the histogram.\n",
    "- element: By default, the histogram is made of bars, but you could set this parameter to \"step\" or \"poly\" to change the appearance of the histogram.\n",
    "Let's look at examples demonstrating some of these parameters:"

    "Congratulations! You have now extended your seaborn capabilities to draw and customize histograms, which are one of the first tools of choice in exploratory data analysis. As we learned, histograms show the distribution of a numerical variable, and it's considered the simplest representation of a distribution. Thanks to Seaborn and Matplotlib's customization options, we've seen how easy it is to make a histogram more understandable.\n",
