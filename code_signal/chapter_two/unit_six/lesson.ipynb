    "# Getting Started with Categorical Relations - Leveraging the Power of Bar Plots\n",
    "As we surf through the waves of data visualization, we'll explore how to utilize bar plots to represent categorical relations. We have already learned how to create bar plots in the previous lessons. However, the ability to use it effectively to visualize categorical relations will help us understand the dataset in a more profound way and answer intriguing questions about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization is a powerful tool that can not only explain complex data trends and patterns easily but can also provide valuable insight into categorical relationships and correlations between different data variables. If we take the Titanic passengers as an example, a bar plot can show us how the passenger class (pclass), gender (sex), and embarkation port (embarked) affect survival rates. Now, isn't that an insightful piece of information that can help us predict or analyze the survival rate better?\n",

    "# Bar Plots for Categorical Data \n",
    "\n",
    "Bar plots, also known as bar graphs, are used to display and compare the number, frequency, or other measures (e.g., mean) for different categories or groups. When dealing with a dataset such as the Titanic dataset, we have several categorical variables - sex, pclass, and embarked. Bar plots can be helpful to visualize the counts of these categorical variables. Saving the best for the last - Seaborn's countplot function makes it extremely convenient to plot these counts.\n",

    "Seaborn provides multiple options to customize your bar plots for better readability and presentation. Here are some of the key parameters you can adjust in the countplot function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- hue - This parameter allows you to represent an additional categorical variable by colors. It becomes very handy in analyzing how the distribution of categories changes with respect to other categorical variables.\n",
    "- color - This parameter lets you set a specific color for all the plot bars.\n",
    "- order and hue_order - These parameters can be useful in arranging the bars in a specific order. You can provide an ordered list of categories to these parameters to adjust the ordering of bars.\n",
    "- orient - This parameter can be used to change the plot's orientation. By default, it's set to 'v' for vertical plots. You can change it to 'h' for horizontal plots.\n",
