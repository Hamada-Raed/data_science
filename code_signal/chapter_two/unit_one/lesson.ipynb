    "Welcome to our course, Intro to Data Visualization with Titanic - an in-depth exploration into the techniques and methodologies of data visualization using Python. This course is designed to provide you with comprehensive insights into real-world scenarios, helping you understand the invaluable concept of data visualization and its applications in today's data-driven world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first lesson of this course, we will explore the detailed properties of the Titanic dataset available from Seaborn - the dataset containing the demographic and passenger information from the 891 surviving passengers out of the 2214 on board the Titanic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the data we're working with is foundational in data analysis because it lets us gain better insights into it and spot potential errors. It also helps us form a reliable basis for further intricate analysis. The runtime of this process can vary solely based on the characteristics of the dataset and what we intend to understand from it.\n",

    "First, let's briefly go over the features of the Titanic dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "survived: Whether the passenger survived (0 = No; 1 = Yes).\n",
    "pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd).\n",
    "- sex: Sex of the passenger (male or female).\n",
    "- age: Age of the passenger (float number).\n",
    "- sibsp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.\n",
    "- parch: Number of parents/children aboard.\n",
    "- fare: Passenger fare (in British pounds).\n",
    "- embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).\n",
    "... and more!\n",
